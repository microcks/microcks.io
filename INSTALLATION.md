# Setting Up the Microcks.io Repository

Follow these steps to set up the Microcks.io repository locally.

## 1. Fork the Repository
First, fork the [Microcks.io repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks.io) to your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone the Repository
Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/microcks.io.git
```

Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username.

## 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

```

## 4. Install Hugo
Microcks.io is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You need to install it to run the website locally.

Follow the official installation guide for your operating system: [Hugo Installation](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

## 5. Start the Local Server
Run the following command to start the local development server:
