As we close the chapter on **2025**, we cant to take a moment to sincerely thank **our adopters**, **contributors**, **sponsors**, **partners**, and **community members**. Your continued trust, engagement, and energy are what drive Microcks' growth year after year.

{{< image src="images/blog/recap-of-an-incredible-2025-feature.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

2025 has been a **transformational year** for Microcks. It drove massive adoption growth, fostered deeper ecosystem collaborations, strengthened community ownership, and facilitated global expansion. It also reinforced our belief in **open source**, **better-together principles** and **cloud native collaboration**.

Let’s look back at some of the highlights before we step confidently into **2026**.

## 🚀 Microcks in Numbers

2025 clearly exceeded our expectations and our KPIs across almost every dimension:

> Microcks is no longer just growing; it’s **scaling globally**.

* **📦 2.5+ million container image downloads in 2025**, compared to **850k total downloads in 2024**. That’s **more than 3× growth year over year**.
* **🔗 3,300+** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microcks/) **followers**, with **+700 new followers in 2025**, showing steady and organic growth.
* **⭐ 1,800 GitHub stars** on the [main repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks) (**+300 in 2025**). While this is solid progress, we believe there’s much more potential here, and we welcome ideas from the community to help amplify this metric.
* **🏢 34 public** adopters in total. We’re especially grateful to the **13 organizations that joined the public adopters list in 2025**. Public references are critical for open source sustainability, and we warmly invite private adopters to help the project and the community by adding themselves 🙏 **[here](https://github.com/microcks/.github/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md)**.
* **🌍 Global expansion continues**, with new users across all regions. Microcks **documentation traffic** insights from Scarf.sh and Google Analytics confirm strong worldwide adoption growth throughout the year.

## 🙌 Community Contributions

Open source lives and thrives through its **people**, and 2025 proved once again how strong the Microcks community is!

### ❤️ The Heart of Microcks

A **huge thank you** to [**Harshvardhan Parmar**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshvardhan-parmar/) from the [Yosemite Crew](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yosemitecrew/), who became a **Code Owner** (Domain Maintainer) for the [Microcks CLI](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-cli).  

> This recognition highlights his outstanding contributions, technical leadership, and ongoing impact on the project 👏

Harshvardhan joins [**Sébastien Degodez**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastien-degodez/) ([AXA France](https://www.linkedin.com/company/axa-france/)), **Code Owner** of the [Testcontainers .NET library](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-dotnet) since 2024, and leads the [**Microsoft Aspire** integrations](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-aspire).

> This **growing maintainer base**, backed by dedicated individuals and organizations, is a cornerstone of the **project’s long-term sustainability**.

### 📊 Contributor Growth in 2025

Behind the numbers lies what matters most to us: a **strong, collaborative, and invested community**. Microcks continues to grow thanks to a diverse group of contributors who not only use the project but also actively help shape it.

What we are particularly grateful for is that **many of our contributors are also adopters of Microcks**. These individuals and organizations rely on Microcks in real-world, business contexts, and they clearly understand a fundamental **open source principle**:

> If you like and **depend on** a project, you should **invest in** it.

This mindset is incredibly powerful. It means improvements are driven by real needs, feedback is grounded in practice, and the project evolves in ways that directly benefit the broader community. As maintainers, we couldn’t agree more with this approach, and we **deeply appreciate** and **support** the organizations that choose to **contribute back**.

In 2025, this collaboration translated into:

* **167 active contributors**  
   *What it represents:* unique individuals contributing code, reviews, issues, documentation, and ideas throughout the year.  
   *Why it matters:* this reflects a vibrant, healthy, and engaged community where innovation is shared and collective.

* **35 active organizations**  
   *What it represents:* contributors affiliated with a wide range of companies and institutions.  
   *Why it matters:* this diversity strengthens the project’s resilience, reduces dependency on any single entity, and ensures long-term sustainability.
