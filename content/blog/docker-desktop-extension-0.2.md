We are very excited to announce the availability of [Microcks Docker Desktop Extension](https://microcks.io/documentation/installing/docker-desktop-extension/) `0.2.0`! This new version of [our popular extension](https://dev.to/docker/9-docker-extensions-every-developer-must-try-1no2) includes exciting enhancements designed to simplify and streamline API mocking and testing processes. This release focused on improving the user experience and expanding the extension's capabilities. We are also excited to announce that we are increasing the frequency of our releases to provide our users with more frequent updates and features.

Our team has worked hard to make the Microcks Docker Desktop Extension more comprehensive and robust. 

## Enhanced Features

The extension brings the capabilities of Microcks directly to your local development environment. It integrates seamlessly with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), allowing developers to mock and test APIs without complex setup or deployment quickly. The extension improves the [Microcks](https://microcks.io/) experience by offering a user-friendly interface, quick access to API mock URLs, and optional integration with popular tools such as Postman. It enables developers to efficiently simulate API responses, test their applications, and shorten the development cycle while remaining in their familiar development environment.

In this release, we have introduced two major highlights:

### API Mock URLs in the Main Extension Page

One of the most significant improvements is the inclusion of API mock URLs directly on the main extension page. This enhancement gives users quick access to mock URLs for their APIs, making sharing and integrating with other tools or team members easier. With a single glance, you can retrieve the URLs required to simulate API responses efficiently.

### Postman Runtime as an Optional Component

We recognize that not all users use [Postman](https://postman.com) for API testing. In response to popular demand and to simplify your deployment, we have added Postman as an optional component that can be activated from the Microcks Docker Desktop Extension's settings page.

## Increased Cadence and Future Roadmap

At Microcks, we are dedicated to providing you with the best possible experience and to constantly improving our tools. With the release of Microcks Docker Desktop Extension `0.2.0`, we are also excited to announce an increase in our release cadence. We will deliver more frequent updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements to ensure that you have access to the most recent capabilities and improvements.

In addition, we are excited to share a sneak peek at our future release roadmap. One highly anticipated feature in our pipeline is the direct API specification upload from the extension's page. This enhancement will allow developers to upload API specifications, such as OpenAPI or GraphQL APIs, directly from the extension's interface. By simplifying the process of importing API specifications, we aim to streamline the API mocking and testing workflows further, giving developers even more flexibility and convenience. 

We are actively working on several exciting features for upcoming releases. We value your feedback and suggestions in shaping the future of Microcks, and we encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas.
