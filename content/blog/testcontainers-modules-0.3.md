To start the 2025 Year fresh, we're delighted to announce the release of the new series of our [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.com) Modules üßä! [Microcks modules](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks) are language-specific libraries that enable embedding Microcks into your unit tests with lightweight, throwaway instances thanks to containers.

The `0.3` series is a major step forward that completes the set of features and elevates Microcks as **a fully featured mocking library for development purposes**. It can be used with different testing styles (classicist, mockist, state-based, and interaction-based) and provides features for all major languages and all kinds of API!

The `0.3` versions are coincident releases made last week on the three main languages we currently support: [Java ‚òïÔ∏è](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-java), [NodeJS/Typescript](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-node) and [Golang](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-go). With those new releases, we now have complete feature parity among the three different technology stacks! We plan to add the same features to the upcoming [.NET module](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-dotnet) that we added to our portfolio in December 2024.

Let's introduce the new features of those releases that complete the picture!

## What's inside?

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Interaction checks

If you spend some time reading about unit the Test Driven Development, you may know that it exists two main schools of thought: the *Classicist* and the *Mockist*. (more on this in [this excellent article](https://medium.com/@adrianbooth/test-driven-development-wars-detroit-vs-london-classicist-vs-mockist-9956c78ae95f))

Until now, Microcks Testcontainers integration was *Classicist* in the sense that it was focused on providing canned responses when the mock endpoints were called. With this `0.3` release, we now also have a *Mockist* approach in case you want to check the interactions of your component under test with a dependent API.

You can now call `verify()` or `getServiceInvocationsCount()` on a Microcks container to check whether an API dependency has actually been called - or not. This is a super powerful way to ensure that your application logic (when to interact with an API) and access policies (caching, no caching, etc.) are correctly implemented and use the mock endpoints only when required!

A big shout out to [pierrechirstinimsa](https://github.com/pierrechristinimsa) üôè who contributed this one for [our Java module](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-java/pull/121) üéâ


#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Access to `messages` in synchronous API contract-testing

The second thing we added in this release is the ability to retrieve exchanged messages when doing contract-testing. Different [contract-testing runners](https://microcks.io/documentation/references/test-endpoints/#test-runner) already exist in Microcks, but they're mainly focused on **syntactical conformance** checking. However, we know that there are [multiple levels of contract testing](https://medium.com/@lbroudoux/different-levels-of-api-contract-testing-with-microcks-ccc0847f8c97).

The new `getMessagesForTestCase()` function on the Microcks container allows you to retrieve the requests and responses that were used during an operation test case. You can then use them to perform extra checks related to **business conformance**; validating, for example, that data retrieval or transformation logic is correctly implemented.

{{< image src="images/blog/testcontainers-modules-0.3-messages.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

These extra checks can be done *manually* directly in the programming language of your tests but you can also delegate them
to frameworks like [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) which are written in plain language by business experts, for running acceptance tests!


#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access to `events` in asynchronous EDA contract-testing

Finally, we also added a way to do the same thing for asynchronous events received during a contract test on an asynchronous broker.

Until now, Microcks `ASYNC_API_SCHEMA` tests allowed you to check that events were fired, correctly sent, read back from - let say - an [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) topic and valid regarding a schema. But what about the content of this event? Was it really related to the business function call that fired it?

The new `getEventMessagesForTestCase()` function allows you to retrieve those events that were read from the broker topic and - here again - perform extra checks. Typically, you can validate that the data from the event is correctly correlated to the original data that triggered the event emission.

> üí° _In the the case of EDA, those checks are also tightly related to interaction checks; and this is a situation we faced during the development of the supporting demo application! Once we added them, we realized that our Kafka producer had a flushing issue and that we received more messages than we expected! Due to a [too low timeout configuration](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-go-demo/blob/main/internal/service/order_event_publisher.go#L85), events were not sent at the right time, introducing de-synchronization and collisions! üí•


## Enthusiastic?

We hope this walkthrough has made you enthusiastic about this new set of features in Microcks Testcontainers `0.3`! The best thing is that you don't have to wait for another Microcks release to test them out as they leverage APIs and features that have been present for a long time in Microcks core!
