While [Docker](https://docker.io) is still the #1 option for software packaging and installation on the developer laptop, [Podman](https://podman.io) is gaining traction. Podman advertises itself as a drop-in replacement for Docker. Just put `alias podman=docker` and you would be good to go, they said 😉

Whilst the reality is a bit more nuanced, we made the necessary adjustment to make it as simple. Today it is a pleasure to contribute back this adaptation to the Microcks community! It will allow Podman early and happy adopters - like me - to run Microcks on their laptop in the safest way.

> Starting as of version `1.2.0` of Microcks, we thus announce the Podman Compose support for quickly getting started with Microcks on your laptop. We still recommend using Kubernetes ☸️ for serious use-cases 😉

## Give it a try!

As explained in the [Installing with podman-compose doc](../../documentation/guides/installation/podman-compose), you should first ensure that you have [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) and [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) packages installed.

Then it's just a matter of cloning the repository, navigating to correct folder and running our supporting script that runs Podman in **rootless** mode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microcks/microcks.git
cd microcks/install/podman-compose
./run-microcks.sh
```

```sh
Running rootless containers...
Discovered host IP address: 192.168.3.102

Starting Microcks using podman-compose ...
------------------------------------------
Stop it with:  podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity stop
Re-launch it with:  podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity start
Clean everything with:  podman-compose -f microcks.yml --transform_policy=identity down
------------------------------------------
Go to https://localhost:8080 - first login with admin/123
Having issues? Check you have changed microcks.yml to your platform

using podman version: podman version 2.1.1
podman run [...]
```

🎉 This will start the required containers and setup an simple environment for your usage.

Open a new browser tab and point to the `http://localhost:8080` endpoint. This will redirect you to the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Single Sign On page for login. Use the following default credentials (**admin**/**123**) to login into the application and start using Microcks.

Want to see what's running? Check the running containers with:

```sh
podman ps

## Want to have more?

Podman adopt a very different architecture from Docker: it involves no daemon at all and can run as a regular user (**rootless** mode) or as root (**rootfull** mode).

If your a Podman user and hapy with it (or if you struggle making it working 😉) come and say hi! on our [Discord chat](https://microcks.io/discord-invite/) 🐙
