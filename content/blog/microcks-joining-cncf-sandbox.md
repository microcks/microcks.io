As a Sandbox project within the CNCF, Microcks gains a significant milestone in its journey. This recognition by the CNCF, a prominent organization driving the adoption and standardization of cloud-native technologies, is a testament to Microcks' potential to contribute to the cloud-native ecosystem.e

Joining the CNCF will provide Microcks with an enhanced platform for collaboration and innovation. It opens up opportunities to engage with a diverse community of developers, organizations, and industry experts at the forefront of cloud-native technologies. We look forward to collaborating [even more with other CNCF projects](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7076562037866147840), contributing our technical expertise, and exploring integration possibilities.

We want to express our gratitude to our vibrant community who have worked tirelessly to make Microcks a thriving project. Their passion, expertise, and unwavering commitment to the open source principles have driven Microcks' growth and helped it reach this significant milestone.
