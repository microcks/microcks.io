#### 1.5.2 on 02 Jun 2022

We are delighted to announce the `1.5.2` release of Microcks ‚ôªÔ∏è This is mainly an ‚ÄúEnhancement release‚Äù pushing further the [Microcks‚Äô Hub and Marketplace](https://microcks.io/blog/microcks-hub-announcement/) we introduced a few weeks ago.

In our vision, the Hub will hold a central place that will allow Microcks users to easily reuse **curated API Mocks & Test suites in a single click** - but also to share and publish their own. That‚Äôs why we absolutely wanted to have a nice **integration between the Hub and Microcks** - and that‚Äôs the purpose of this release.
