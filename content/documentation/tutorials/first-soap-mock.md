## Overview

This tutorial is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to use [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org) projects to get mocks for your SOAP WebService. This is hands-on introduction to [SoapUI Conventions reference](/documentation/references/artifacts/soapui-conventions) that brings all details on conventions being used.

We will go through a practical example based on the famous PetStore API. We‚Äôll build the reference [petstore-1.0-soapui-project.xml](../petstore-1.0-soapui-project.xml) file by iterations, highlighting the details to get you starting with mocking SOAP WebServices on Microcks.

Of course, to complete this tutorial, you will need to install [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/) to define mocks on top of the WSDL file that describes your SOAP WebService interface. To validate that our mock is working correctly, you'll be able to reuse SoapUI as-well but we'll also provide simple `curl` commands.

Let's start! üí•

## 1. Setup Microcks, a WSDL skeleton and a SoapUI project

First mandatory step is obviously to setup Microcks üòâ. For OpenAPI usage, we don't need any particular setup and the simple `docker` way of deploying Microcks as exposed in [Getting started](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started) is perfectly suited. Following the getting started, you should have a Microcks running instance on `http://localhost:8585`.

> This could be on another port if `8585` is already used on your machine.

Following the getting started, you should have a Microcks running instance on `http://localhost:8585`.

Now let start with the skeleton of our WSDL contract for the Petstore Service. We'll start with the definition of two different types:
* `Pet` is the data structure that represents a registered pet in our store - it has an `id` and a `name`,
* `PetsResponse` is a structure that allows returning many pets as a service method result.

We also have the definition of one `getPets` operation that allow returning all the pets in the store. This is over-simplistic but enough to help demonstrate how to do things. Here's the WSDL contract (yes, it's pretty verbose üòÖ):

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<wsdl:definitions xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"
    xmlns:tns="http://www.acme.org/petstore" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/"
    name="PetstoreService" targetNamespace="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
  <wsdl:types>
    <xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:tns="http://www.acme.org/petstore" targetNamespace="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
      <xs:complexType name="Pet">
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element name="id" type="xs:int"/>
          <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:complexType>
      <xs:complexType name="PetsResponse">
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" name="pet" type="tns:Pet" />
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:complexType>

      <xs:element name="getPets">
        <xs:complexType/>
      </xs:element>
      <xs:element name="getPetsResponse" type="tns:PetsResponse" />
    </xs:schema>
  </wsdl:types>

  <wsdl:message name="getPets">
    <wsdl:part element="tns:getPets" name="parameters" />
  </wsdl:message>
  <wsdl:message name="getPetsResponse">
    <wsdl:part element="tns:getPetsResponse" name="parameters" />
  </wsdl:message>

  <wsdl:portType name="PetstoreService">
    <wsdl:operation name="getPets">
      <wsdl:input message="tns:getPets" name="getPets"/>
      <wsdl:output message="tns:getPetsResponse" name="getPetsResponse"/>
    </wsdl:operation>
  </wsdl:portType>

  <wsdl:binding name="PetstoreServiceSoapBinding" type="tns:PetstoreService">
    <soap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" />
    <wsdl:operation name="getPets">
      <soap:operation soapAction="http://www.acme.org/petstore/getPets" style="document" />
      <wsdl:input>
        <soap:body use="literal" />
      </wsdl:input>
      <wsdl:output>
        <soap:body use="literal" />
      </wsdl:output>
    </wsdl:operation>
  </wsdl:binding>
  <wsdl:service name="PetstoreService">
    <wsdl:port binding="tns:PetstoreServiceSoapBinding" name="PetstoreServiceEndpointPort">
      <soap:address location="http://localhost:8080/services/PetstoreService" />
    </wsdl:port>
  </wsdl:service>
</wsdl:definitions>
```

From now, you can save this as a file on your disk - or your can retrieve our finalized [petstore-1.0.wsdl](../petstore-1.0.wsdl) file. Then open SoapUI and choose **New SOAP Project** in the **File** menu or from the top buttons bar. Give your project a name like `PetstoreService` and choose to **Upload** this file as its definition. It should create a new folder for your project on the left pane initialized with a Service named `PetstoreServiceSoapBinding`.

We now have some more initialization work to do. This is a four steps process that is illustrated below in the slider (you can the blue dots to freeze the swiper below):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Right-click on the imported binding and ask SoapUI to generate a new mock server for this binding,,

2Ô∏è‚É£ Keep the default options on the generation form. You can check that the `getPets` operation is correctly detected,

3Ô∏è‚É£ You have now to name the mock server - this will be the name that will appear later in Microcks. Prefer something simple like `PetstoreService` for example,

4Ô∏è‚É£ On the newly created mock server, use the left pane to add a custom properties named `version` having `1.0` as a value. This is one of [our conventions](/documentation/references/artifacts/soapui-conventions/) for SoapUI projects.

<div class="swiper single-slider" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-initial-generate-mock-1.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}      
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-initial-generate-mock-2.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-initial-mock-name.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-initial-version.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
</div>

To finish this first preparation step, you can save this project as a XML file on your disk, then open Microcks in your browser and go to the **Importers** page in the left navigation menu and choose to **Upload** this file. The file should import correctly and you should receive a toast notifiation on the upper right corner. Then, while browsing **APIs | Services**, you should get acess to the following details in Microcks:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-initial-import.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

## 2. Specifying mock data with SoapUI

We have loaded a SoapUI project in Microcks that correctly discovered the structure of your WebService, but you have no sample data loaded at the moment. We're going to fix this using SoapUI by defining:
* a Ressponse in the `PetstoreService` Mock Server,
* a Request in a new **Test Suite** for our Service.

Let's start by the request. This is a three steps process that is illustrated below in the slider (you can the blue dots to freeze the swiper below):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Right-click on the imported binding and ask SoapUI to generate a new test suite server for this binding,,

2Ô∏è‚É£ Keep the default options on the generation form. You can check that the `getPets` operation is correctly detected,

3Ô∏è‚É£ You can now rename the mock server. I like sticking with simple names like `PetstoreService`,

<div class="swiper single-slider" style="margin-bottom: 20px">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px">
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-generate-suite.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-suite-form.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-suite-name.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
</div>

You can open and check the default `getPets` request that has been created in the Test Suite. This one is basic has we have no arguments in the request.

Let's now take care of the rseponse definition. The `PetstoreService` Mock Server has been initialized with a default request named `Request 1`.
To tell Microcks that this one should match with the request we just defined, we have to rename it and simply call it `getPets` as well. 
This is one of [our conventions](/documentation/references/artifacts/soapui-conventions/) for SoapUI projects.

Edit the content of this response to put some sample data:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
  <soapenv:Header/>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <pet:getPetsResponse>
      <pet>
        <id>1</id>
        <name>Zaza</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>2</id>
        <name>Tigress</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>3</id>
        <name>Maki</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>4</id>
        <name>Toufik</name>
      </pet>
    </pet:getPetsResponse>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

Finally, the last thing we have to do is to change the dispatcher that is set on the Mock Server `getPets` operation. As illustrated below, change its value from the default `SEQUENCE` to `RANDOM`:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-final.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

## 3. Basic operation of SOAP service

It's now the moment to import this SoapUI Project back in Microcks and see the results! Go to the **Importers** page in the left navigation menu and choose to **Upload** this file. Your SOAP WebService details should now have been updated with the samples you provided via the SoapUI Project:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-getPets.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

> ü§î You may have noticed in the above section and screenshot that dispatching rules are empty for now. This is normal as we're on a basic operation with no routing logic. We'll talk about dispatchers in next section.

Microcks has found `getPets` as a valid sample to build a simulation upon. A mock URL has been made available. We can use this to test the query as demonstrated below with a `curl` command:

```shell
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8585/soap/PetstoreService/1.0' -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
   -d '<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore"><soapenv:Header/><soapenv:Body><pet:getPets/></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>'

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
  <soapenv:Header/>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <pet:getPetsResponse>
      <pet>
        <id>1</id>
        <name>Zaza</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>2</id>
        <name>Tigress</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>3</id>
        <name>Maki</name>
      </pet>
      <pet>
        <id>4</id>
        <name>Toufik</name>
      </pet>
    </pet:getPetsResponse>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

This is your first gRPC mock üéâ Nice achievement!

## 4. Using SOAP request element

Let's make things a bit more spicy by adding request parameters. Now assume we want to provide a simple searching operation to retrieve all pets in store using simple filter. We'll end up adding a new `searchPets` method in our WebService. Of course, we'll have to define a new `searchPetsRequest` input message so that users will specify `name=zoe` to get all the pets having `zoe` in name.

So we'll add new things in our WSDL document like below: new elements, messages and we complete the service with a new `saerchPets` operation: 

```xml
<wsdl:types>
  <xs:schema>
    <!-- [...] -->
    <xs:element name="searchPets">
      <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" name="name" type="xs:string" />
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
    <xs:element name="searchPetsResponse" type="tns:PetsResponse" />
  </xs:schema>
</wsdl:types>

<wsdl:message name="searchPets">
  <wsdl:part element="tns:searchPets" name="parameters" />
</wsdl:message>
<wsdl:message name="searchPetsResponse">
  <wsdl:part element="tns:searchPetsResponse" name="parameters" />
</wsdl:message>

<wsdl:portType name="PetstoreService">
  <!-- [...] -->
  <wsdl:operation name="searchPets">
    <wsdl:input message="tns:searchPets" name="searchPets"/>
    <wsdl:output message="tns:searchPetsResponse" name="searchPetsResponse"/>
  </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:portType>
<!-- [...] -->
<wsdl:binding name="PetstoreServiceSoapBinding" type="tns:PetstoreService">
  <soap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" />
  <!-- [...] -->
  <wsdl:operation name="searchPets">
    <soap:operation soapAction="http://www.acme.org/petstore/searchPets" style="document" />
    <wsdl:input>
      <soap:body use="literal" />
    </wsdl:input>
    <wsdl:output>
      <soap:body use="literal" />
    </wsdl:output>
  </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:binding>
```

You can then refresh the Service definition in SoapUI to have it detect the new operation. Still in SoapUi, you must now add the new operation to your Mock Server and a new Test Case to the existing Test Suite. Let's complete our samples data with two new requests and responses for the new `searchPets` operation:
* One request/response pair for searching for pets having a `k` in their name. We'll name it `searchPets K`,
* Another request/response pair for searching for pets having a `i` in their name. We'll name it `searchPets I`

This is the results you should achieve below:

<div class="swiper single-slider">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-kpets.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-ipets.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
</div>


What about the dispatcher property we mentioned earlier? FOr this operation, we're going to use another dispatcher that allows to analyse the incoming SOAP body to find the correst response. This dispatcher is called `QUERY_MATCH` and uses [XPath expression](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) to extract data from incoming request to get the response. 

To set this dispatcher configuration, you will have to go on the Mock Server `searchPaets` operation properties and select the appropriate **QUERY_MATCH** option. Then, for each request you'll have to add a matching rule (let's name them `match_i` and `match_k` for example) and define an XPath expression. You'll have to use this expression below that declares an alias `pet` for the Xml namespace of your query and a selector to extract the incoming `name` property:

```txt
declare namespace pet='http://www.acme.org/petstore';
//pet:searchPets/name
```

Then, based on this property value (`k` or `i`), you'll define to return either the `searchPets K` or the `searchPets I` response. You should achieve the following results in SoapUI:

<div class="swiper single-slider">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-kpets-dispatch.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-ipets-dispatch.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
</div>

> üö® Take care of saving your edits before exporting!

Import this updated SoapUI Project back in Microcks and see the results:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-searchPets.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

Let's try the new SOAP operation mock with this command:

```shell
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/soap/PetstoreService/1.0' -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
   -d '<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore"><soapenv:Header/><soapenv:Body> <pet:searchPets><name>i</name></pet:searchPets></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>'

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <pet:searchPetsResponse>
         <pet>
            <id>2</id>
            <name>Tigress</name>
         </pet>
         <pet>
            <id>3</id>
            <name>Maki</name>
         </pet>
         <pet>
            <id>4</id>
            <name>Toufik</name>
         </pet>
      </pet:searchPetsResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope
```

and this one:

```shell
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/soap/PetstoreService/1.0' -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
   -d '<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore"><soapenv:Header/><soapenv:Body> <pet:searchPets><name>k</name></pet:searchPets></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>'
   
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <pet:searchPetsResponse>
         <pet>
            <id>3</id>
            <name>Maki</name>
         </pet>
         <pet>
            <id>4</id>
            <name>Toufik</name>
         </pet>
      </pet:searchPetsResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope
```

üéâ Fantastic! We now have a mock with routing logic based on request Xml conetnt.

## 5. Mocking a creation operation

And now the final step! Let's deal with a new method that allows registering a new pet within the Petstore. For that, you'll typically have to define a new `createPet` operation on the `PetstoreService`. In order to be meaningful to the user of this operation, a mock would have to integrate some logic that reuse contents from the incoming request and/or generate sample data. That's typically what we're going to do in this last section üòâ

Let's add such a new operation into the WSDL document file by adding the following elements:

```xml
<wsdl:types>
  <xs:schema>
    <!-- [...] -->
    <xs:element name="createPet">
      <xs:complexType>
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" name="name" type="xs:string" />
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:complexType>
    </xs:element>
    <xs:element name="createPetResponse" type="tns:Pet" />
  </xs:schema>
</wsdl:types>

<wsdl:message name="createPet">
  <wsdl:part element="tns:createPet" name="parameters" />
</wsdl:message>
<wsdl:message name="createPetResponse">
  <wsdl:part element="tns:screatePetResponse" name="parameters" />
</wsdl:message>

<wsdl:portType name="PetstoreService">
  <!-- [...] -->
  <wsdl:operation name="createPet">
    <wsdl:input message="tns:createPet" name="createPet"/>
    <wsdl:output message="tns:createPetResponse" name="createPetResponse"/>
  </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:portType>
<!-- [...] -->
<wsdl:binding name="PetstoreServiceSoapBinding" type="tns:PetstoreService">
  <soap:binding style="document" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" />
  <!-- [...] -->
  <wsdl:operation name="createPet">
    <soap:operation soapAction="http://www.acme.org/petstore/createPet" style="document" />
    <wsdl:input>
      <soap:body use="literal" />
    </wsdl:input>
    <wsdl:output>
      <soap:body use="literal" />
    </wsdl:output>
  </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:binding>
```

You can then refresh the Service definition in SoapUI to have it detect the new operation. Still in SoapUi, you must now add the new operation to your Mock Server and a new Test Case to the existing Test Suite. Let's complete our samples data with a new request/response pair for the new `createPet` operation.

The request will use a statically defined pet name to be created (here `Jojo` in the screenshot) but, as said above, we want to define a smart mock with some logic. Thankfully, Microcks has this ability to generate [dynamic mock content](/documentation/explanations/dynamic-content). When defining our example into SoapUI, we're are going to use two specific notations that are:

* `{{ randomInt(5,10) }}` for asking Microcks to generate a random integer between 5 and 10 for us (remember: the other pets have ids going from 1 to 4),
* `{{ request.body//*[local-name() = 'name'] }}` for asking Microcks to reuse here the `name` property of the request body. Simply.

Let's complete our SoapUI with a new request and a new response - both named `createPet`- for the new `createPet` operation. Do not forget to also update the **Disptacher** of the Mock Server operation as illustrated below:

<div class="swiper single-slider">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-createPet.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">
      {{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-data-createPet-dispatch.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
</div>

> üö® Take care of saving your edits before exporting!

Import this updated SoapUI Project back in Microcks and see the results:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-soap-createPet.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

Let's now finally test this new operation using some content and see what's going on:

```shell
$ curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8585/soap/PetstoreService/1.0' -H 'Content-Type: application/xml' \
   -d '<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore"><soapenv:Header/><soapenv:Body><pet:createPet><name>Rusty</name></pet:createPet></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>'

<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:pet="http://www.acme.org/petstore">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <pet:createPetResponse>
         <id>7</id>
         <name>Rusty</name>
      </pet:createPetResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

As a result we've got our pet name `Rusty` being returned with a new `id` being generated. Ta Dam! ü•≥

> üõ†Ô∏è As a validation, send a few more requests changing your pet name. You'll check that given name is always returned and the `id` is actual random. But you can also go further by defining an [advanced dispatcher](/documentation/explanations/dispatching/#script-dispatcher) that will inspect your request body content to decide which response must be sent back. Very useful to describe different creation or error cases!

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial we have seen the basics on how Microcks can be used to mock responses of a SOAP WebService. We introduced some Microcks concepts like examples, dispatchers and templating features that are used to produce a live simulation. This definitely helps speeding-up the feedback loop on the ongoing design as the development of a consumer using this service.
