## Overview

This tutorial is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to use [AsyncAPI v3 Specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/) to specify your mocks for your Asynchronous and Event-Driven API. This is hands-on introduction to [AsyncAPI Conventions reference](/documentation/references/artifacts/asyncapi-conventions) that brings all details on conventions being used.

We will go through a practical example based on the famous PetStore API. We‚Äôll build the reference [petstore-1.0.0-asyncapi.yaml](../petstore-1.0.0-asyncapi.yaml) file by iterations, highlighting the details to get you starting with mocking AsyncAPI on Microcks.

To complete this tutorial, you will need one additional tool that ic `kcat`, a simple CLI utility that allows you reading messages on a [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) topic. Please follow the [instructions on how to install `kcat`](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat?tab=readme-ov-file#install) on your machine.

Ready? Go! üí•

## 1. Setup Microcks and AsyncAPI skeleton

First mandatory step is obviously to setup Microcks üòâ. For AsyncAPI usage, we need a particular setup that embeds an Apache Kafka broker linked to a Microcks instance. Do not worry, we made this available for you as a simple `docker compose` command! 

> As an alternative, you could also use our [Docker Desktop Extension](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/installation/docker-desktop-extension/) if you feel more comfortable with graphical tools.

To retrieve and start the `docker compose` configuration, just execute the following commands, adapting the folder to one of your choice:

```shell
cd ~/Development/temp
git clone https://github.com/microcks/microcks
cd microcks/install/docker-compose
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

`docker` pulls the missing container images and starts 5 containers:

```sh

You can check everything is running correctly with the `docker ps` command that should provide you something like:

```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                                       NAMES

```

You should now have a Microcks running instance on `http://localhost:8080`.

> Please edit the `docker-compose-devmode.yml` file to change this port if `8080` is already used on your machine.

Now let start with the skeleton of our AsyncAPI contract for the PetStore API. We'll start with general information on this API and with definition of the `Pet` datatype. `Pet` will be used directly as our Kafka message and we'll provide two examples of existing pets. 

This is over-simplistic but enough to help demonstrate how to do things. Here's the YAML representing this part of the AsyncAPI contract:

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Petstore Asynchronous API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |-
    A sample API that uses a petstore as an example to demonstrate features
    in the AsyncAPI 3.0 specification and Microcks

defaultContentType: application/json

      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
      examples:
        - name: Zaza
          payload:
            id: 1
            name: Zaza
        - name: Tigress
          payload:
            id: 2
            name: Tigress
  schemas:
    Pet:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          format: int64
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
      required:
        - id
        - name
```

## 2. Basic receive operation in AsyncAPI

Let's now define a first channel and a first operation to this API. We want give a consumer the ability to receive events when new pets are recorded into the store. Hence, we'll define a `newPetCreated` channel in our API. We'll also define a `receive` operation that will allow consumers to subscribe to a topic and received new `Pet` events. Just paste the content below at the end of above skeleton:

```yaml
channels:
  newPetCreated:
    address: new-pet
    messages:
      newPetCreated:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/pet'
operations:
  receiveNewPetCreateEvent:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/newPetCreated'
    messages:
      - $ref: '#/channels/newPetCreated/messages/newPetCreated'
```

Because of the `application/json` content type, we can express examples as JSON or as YAML objects. Examples are really helpful when carefully chosen to represent real-life samples very close to actual functional situation. Here I've put my real cats üêà names.

As soon as your contract contains examples, you can import it into Microcks and it will use examples to produce real life simulation of your API. Use the [Direct Upload](/documentation/guides/usage/importing-content/#1-import-content-via-upload) method to inject your AsyncAPI file in Microcks. You should get the following result:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-async-basic.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

Microcks has found `Zaza` and `Tigress` as valid samples to build a simulation upon. A Kafka Topic has been made available and you can use it to test the API operation as demonstrated below with a `kcat` command:

```sh
$ kcat -b localhost:9092 -t PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent [0] at offset 14
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent [0] at offset 16
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent [0] at offset 18
```

This is your first AsyncAPI mock üéâ Nice achievement!

## 3. Using channel parameters in AsyncAPI

Let's make things a bit more spicy by adding channel parameters. Now assume we have a lot of events and we want consumers to be able to filter events using a characteristic of our pets - let's say the `color`. We want the consumer to be able to select the exact topic she wants and for that we'll use [parameters in channel address](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/concepts/asyncapi-document/dynamic-channel-address).

So we'll start adding a new `PetWithColor` datatype to our existing AsyncAPI document. You can copy/paste the following `PetWithColor` fragment into the `components/schemas` sction of your file:

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    [...]
    PetWithColor:
      allOf: 
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
        - properties:
            color:
              type: string
          required:
            - color
```

Then, we'll define a new message type named `petByColor` with a bunch of examples illustrating different cats with different values:

```yaml
components:
  messages:
    [...]
    petByColor:
      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/PetWithColor'
      examples:
        - name: Zaza
          payload:
            id: 1
            name: Zaza
            color: blue
        - name: Tigress
          payload:
            id: 2
            name: Tigress
            color: stripped
        - name: Maki
          payload:
            id: 3
            name: Maki
            color: calico
        - name: Toufik
          payload:
            id: 4
            name: Toufik
            color: stripped
```

Finally, we'll have to define a new channel with parameter for exchanging `petByColor` messages and a new operation that allows consumers to receive those pets with color events:

```yaml
channels:
  [...]
  petByColor:
    address: pet-{color}
    messages:
      petByColor:
        $ref: '#/components/messages/petByColor'
    parameters:
      color:
        location: $message.payload#/color
operation:
  [...]
  receivePetByColorEvent:
    action: receive
    channel:
      $ref: '#/channels/petByColor'
    messages:
      - $ref: '#/channels/petByColor/messages/petByColor'
```

The important thing to notice here is the **location** of the new channel. In fact, AsyncAPI specification allows to specify which element of the message should be used as a discriminator to route messages to specific channel. Here the location is `$message.payload#/color` which means that the `color` property of the message payload will match the `{color}` placeholder in the channel address. When imported into Microcks, you should have following result:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-async-parameter.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

You can see two important changes from the previous operation we created:
* The operation has now a dispatcher named `URI_PARTS` that means that Microcks will create dynamic endpoints/topic having templatized parts (like `pet-{color}` in our case),
* Each example may have a different Kafka Topic associated with. Microcks will dyanmically create them and produce mock messages in the correct ones.

Let's try this on the different topics corresponding to the differnet colors:

```sh
$ kcat -b localhost:9092 -t PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-blue
% Auto-selecting Consumer mode (use -P or -C to override)
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza","color":"blue"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza","color":"blue"}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza","color":"blue"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-blue [0] at offset 3
```

Looks good! Only Zaza is a blue cat. Let's check the others:

```sh
$ kcat -b localhost:9092 -t PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-stripped
% Auto-selecting Consumer mode (use -P or -C to override)
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress","color":"stripped"}
{"id":4,"name":"Toufik","color":"stripped"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress","color":"stripped"}
{"id":4,"name":"Toufik","color":"stripped"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress","color":"stripped"}
{"id":4,"name":"Toufik","color":"stripped"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress","color":"stripped"}
{"id":4,"name":"Toufik","color":"stripped"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigress","color":"stripped"}
{"id":4,"name":"Toufik","color":"stripped"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-stripped [0] at offset 10
^C%    
```

Correct! Tigress and Toufik are the stripped ones. Just confirm with the calico color:

```sh
$ kcat -b localhost:9092 -t PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-calico
% Auto-selecting Consumer mode (use -P or -C to override)
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
{"id":3,"name":"Maki","color":"calico"}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-pet-calico [0] at offset 7
```

üéâ Fantastic! We now have asynchronous mock messages with routing logic based on message elements.

> üí° Microcks dispatcher can support multiple path elements to find appropriate destination to route messages to. It's up to you to use addresses like `static-{part_1}/hello/{part_2}/world` as long as your define all the locations for those parameters.

## 4. Mocking dynamic data

And now the final step! Let's enrich our first operation with more examples. We see how easy it is to add new examples but it can became cumbersome to manage a lot of them. Hopefully, Microcks has this ability to generate [dynamic mock content](/documentation/explanations/dynamic-content). Thanks to a templating language, you can add more dyanmic examples very quickly. Let's add the folowwing `Random` YAML fragment to our existing examples list:

```yaml
components:
  messages:
    pet:
      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
      examples:
        [...]
        - name: Random
          payload: |-
            {
              "id": {{ randomInt(5,10) }},
              "name": "{{ randomValue(Rusty,Poppy,Bella) }}"
            }
```

The `Random` example fragment above embeds two specific notations that are:

* `{{ randomInt(5,10) }}` for asking Microcks to generate a random integer between 5 and 10 for us (remember: the other pets have ids going from 1 to 4),
* `{{ randomValue(Rusty,Poppy,Bella) }}` for asking Microcks to pick a random value among the ones that are provided, separated by a coma. Simply.

When imported into Microcks, you should have following result:

{{< image src="images/documentation/first-async-random.png" alt="image" zoomable="true" >}}

Let's now finally test the first Kafka topic again and see what's going on:

```sh
$ kcat -b localhost:9092 -t PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent
[...]
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigresse"}
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "Poppy"
}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigresse"}
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "Bella"
}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigresse"}
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Bella"
}
{"id":1,"name":"Zaza"}
{"id":2,"name":"Tigresse"}
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "Rusty"
}
% Reached end of topic PetstoreAsynchronousAPI-1.0.0-receiveNewPetCreateEvent [0] at offset 1373
```

As a result we've got now pets with random `id` and `names` mixed with our first two static examples. Ta Dam! ü•≥

## Wrap-Up

In this tutorial we have seen the basics on how Microcks can be used to mock responses of an AsyncAPI. We introduced some Microcks concepts like examples, dispatchers and templating features that are used to produce a live simulation. This definitely helps speeding-up the feedback loop on the ongoing design as the development of an application consuming this API.
