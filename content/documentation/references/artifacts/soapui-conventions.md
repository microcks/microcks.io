## Conventions

In order to be correctly imported and understood by Microcks, your SoapUI project should follow a little set of reasonable conventions and best practices.

* Your SoapUI project may contain one or more Service definitions. However, because it's a best practice to consider each Service or API as an autonomous and isolated software asset, we'd recommend managing only one Service definition per SoapUI project,
* Your SoapUI Mock Service should define a custom property named `version` that allows tracking of Service(s) version. It is a good practice to change this version identifier for each Service or API interface versioned changes,
* The name of Tests Requests should be something like `"<sample_id> Request"`. For example: `"Karla Request"`,
* The name of Mock Responses should be something like `"<sample_id> Response"`. For example: `"Karla Response"`,
* The name of matching rules should be something like `"<sample_id>"`. For example: `"Karla"`,

We recommend having a look at our sample SoapUI projects for [SOAP WebServices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microcks/microcks/master/samples/HelloService-soapui-project.xml) and for [REST APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microcks/microcks/master/samples/HelloAPI-soapui-project.xml) to fully understand and see in action those conventions.

## Illustration

### Project initialization

Project initialization is as simple as creating a new *Empty Project* in SoapUI. The Tests Request you will need to define later will be defined through a *SoapUI TestSuite* ; the Mock Responses you will need to define later will be defined through a *SoapUI ServiceMock*. It is a better choice to directly create those items through the wizard when choosing the *Add WSDL* or *Add WADL* actions once project has been created.

The screenshot below shows how to add a WSDL to an existing empty project :

### Defining Test Requests

The sample requests that are used by Microcks are *SoapUI TestSuite* requests. So select the newly imported Service, right-click and choose *Generate TestSuite*. You should get this following screenshot where you select these options, validate and then give your TestSuite a name like `"<Service> TestSuite"` or something:

{{< image src="images/documentation/soapui-create-testsuite.png" zoomable="true" >}}

You are now free to create as many *TestSteps* as you want within the *TestCases*. TestCases represents the **Operation** level and TestSteps represents the request sample level. The screenshot below shows how we have created 2 sample requests (`Andrew` and `Karla`) for the `sayHello` operation of our WebService:

{{< image src="images/documentation/soapui-testrequest.png" zoomable="true" >}}

As shown above, you are also free to add some assertions within your TestStep requests. The SoapUI documentation introduces the assertion concept on [this page](https://www.soapui.org/functional-testing/assertion-teststep.html). Assertions in TestSteps can be later reused when wanting to use Microcks for [Contract testing](../tests) of your Service.

### Defining Mock Responses

Mock Responses you will need to define later will be defined through a *SoapUI ServiceMock*. You have to select the newly imported Service, right-click and choose *Generate MockService*. You can let the default options as shown below and give your MockService a name like `"<Service> Mock"`:

{{< image src="images/documentation/soapui-create-servicemock.png" zoomable="true" >}}

You will now be able to create as many *Responses* attached to *Operation* as you've got samples requests defined in previously created *TestSteps*. As introduced into the naming conventions, your responses must have the same `"<sample_id>` radix that the associated requests so that Microcks will be later able to associate them.

The screenshot above shows a Mock response corresponding to the `Andrew Request`. It is simply code `Andrew Response`. Note that you are free to setup any HTTP Header you want for responses, Microcks will reuse them later to issue real headers in responses.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that you can use [templating notation](/documentation/references/templates) into your SOAP responses for better/smarter/more dynamic responses. It brings specific features for XML like [XPath expressions](/documentation/references/templates/#xml-body-xpath-expression) or [context expressions](/documentation/references/templates/#context-expression) you may have initialized using a [`SCRIPT` dispatcher](/documentation/references/explanations/dispatching/#script-dispatcher).

> ðŸ’¡ Note also that for compatibility purpose, Microcks supports the SoapUI expression notation: SoapUI `${ }` notation will be translated into Microcks double-mustaches notation `{{ }}` internally. You may also of course directly use our `{{ }}` notation though ðŸ˜‰

### Defining dispatch rules

Latest step is now to define a technical mean for Microcks to analyse an incoming requests and find out the corresponding response to return. This is done in Microcks via the concept of **Dispatcher** that represent a dispatch strategy and **Dispatcher Rules** that represent the dispatching parameters. Microcks supports 3 strategies for dispatching SOAP requests:

* Via the analysis of SOAP request payload through XPath,
* Via the evaluation of a Groovy script,
* Via the random dispatching strategy.

These three strategies have equivalent in SoapUI via Dispatch configuration on each Operation of your Mock Service.

#### Using XPath expression

After double-clicking on the operation node of your Mock Service, a window as shown in following screenshot should appear. If you want to use XPath for matching, select the *QUERY_MATCH* Dispatch and associate a *Mock Response* (upper section) with a new *Match Rule* (lower left) defining an XPath assertion (lower right). You can use the *Extract* helper in SoapUI if you're not familiar to XPath expression.

> ðŸš¨ **Warning**: The XPath expression used by your different *Match Rule* must strictly be the same. You cannot used different expression for different rules.

Below the example of using the name find in incoming request to find a matching response.

#### Using a Groovy script

> ðŸš¨ **Warning**: Uber-native image doesn't support Groovy scripting as it required dynamic compilation available in JVM mode only. Use the standard Uber version.

Another way of defining matching rules is using a Groovy script. Such a script allows to define much more logic for finding a response for an incoming requests. With scripts you can use request payload but also have access to query string, http headers and so on.
