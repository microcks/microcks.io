The goal of the Microcks project is to accelerate cloud‑native application adoption by addressing the challenges of complex, distributed, multi‑protocol systems:

* **Simplifying API Development & Testing:** Enable teams to rapidly mock and test APIs, including REST, SOAP, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), and [AsyncAPI](https://asyncapi.com).
* **Enhancing API-First Practices:** Support contract-driven development by leveraging API specifications. Microcks verifies that real APIs conform to their defined contract (e.g., [OpenAPI spec](https://www.openapis.org/)) by running manual or automated tests against them.
* **Making API Integration smooth:** Automate API testing and validation within CI/CD pipelines, fully integrated into DevOps workflows.
* **Bridging Business and Technical Stakeholders:** Connect API producers and consumers through standardized API specifications and seamless collaboration.

> 💡 Microcks streamlines the development lifecycle by removing friction in API and microservices integration.
