In order to support [Inner Loop integration or Shift-Left scenarios](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-microcks-fit-unify-inner-outer-loops-cloud-native-kheddache), we've worked recently on a stripped down version of Microcks that makes embedding it in your development workflow, on a laptop, within your unit tests possible. This new distribution is called `microcks-uber` and provides the essential services in a single container as represented below:

> As the Uber distribution of Microcks is perfectly well-adapted for a quick evaluation, we don't recommend running it in production! It doesn't embed the authroization/authentication features provided by Keycloak and the performance guarantees offered by a real external MongoDB instance.

The original purpose of this Uber distribution is to be used through testing libraries like [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com). Though it's very easy to launch it using a simple `docker` command like below, binding the only necessary port to your local `8585`:

```sh
docker run -p 8585:8080 -it quay.io/microcks/microcks-uber:nightly
```

## Testcontainers integration

Microcks now provides official modules for [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) via a partenership with [AtomicJar](https://atomicjar.com/), the company behind this fantastic library! You can find information on the official module on [Testcontainers Microcks page](https://testcontainers.com/modules/microcks/).

As of today, we provide support for following languages:
* Java ‚òïÔ∏è - See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-java) - See our demo application for [Spring Boot](https://github.com/microcks/api-lifecycle/blob/master/shift-left-demo/spring-boot-order-service/README.md) üçÉ and for [Quarkus](https://github.com/microcks/api-lifecycle/blob/master/shift-left-demo/quarkus-order-service/README.md).
* NodeJS - See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-node)
* Go - See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-testcontainers-go)
