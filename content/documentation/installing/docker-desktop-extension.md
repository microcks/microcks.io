[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is a simple-to-install application for [Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), [Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/) that allows you to create and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker Engine, the Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and the Credential Helper.

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker Desktop installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install) on your system.

1. Select Extensions 

2. Choose Microcks, install and launch it and you are ready to go 🤩

> The video just below illustrates the installation process as well as the creation of a first [Direct API](../../using/dynamic/). It has never been simpler to set up and use Microcks on a laptop. 🙌

### Settings

The settings panel allows you to configure some options like whether you'd like to enable the Asynchronous APIs features (default is disabled) and if you'd need to set an offset to ports that are used to access the services.

Pretty straight forward!
