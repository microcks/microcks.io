## Instructions

One easy way of installing Microcks is via a [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/). Kubernetes version 1.17 or greater is required. It is assumed that you have some kind of Kubernetes cluster up and running available. This can take several forms depending on your environment and needs:

* Lightweight Minikube on your laptop, see [Minikube project page](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube),
* A Google Cloud Engine account in the cloud, see how to start a [Free trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial),
* Any other Kubernetes distribution provider.


## Helm 3

Helm 3 chart has been tested from Kubernetes 1.17 and is now available on our own repository. This allows you to install Microcks with just 3 commands:

```sh
$ helm repo add microcks https://microcks.io/helm

$ kubectl create namespace microcks

$ helm install microcks microcks/microcks --version 1.7.1 --namespace microcks --set microcks.url=microcks.$(minikube ip).nip.io --set keycloak.url=keycloak.$(minikube ip).nip.io
```

After some minutes and components have been deployed, you should end up with a Spring-boot Pod, a MongoDB Pod, a Postman-runtime Pod, a Keycloak Pod and a PostgreSQL Pod like in the screenshot below.

Now you can retrieve the URL of the created ingress using `kubectl get ingress -n microcks`.

Before starting to play with Microcks, you'll have to connect to the Keycloak component in order to configure an identity provider or define some users for the Microcks realm (see [Keycloak documentation](http://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#user-management)). Connection to Keycloak can be done using username and password stored into a `microcks-keycloak-config` secret created during setup.

> Starting with Microcks `1.2.0` release, the installation process now creates default users with the different roles available. So you can directly login using `user`, `manager` or `admin` username with `microcks123` password.

For full instructions and deployment options, we recommend reading the [README](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/blob/master/install/kubernetes/README.md) on GitHub repository.

## Minikube setup

The video below shows an install using the Helm chart on Minikube and also shows the post-installation steps required for creating users and connecting to the app (required before the `1.2.0` release):

When using Minikube, depending on what you've already deployed, the default configuration may be little bit slow and induce timeout on readiness probes. We usually setup the following configuration for successful deployments:

```sh
minikube config set cpus 4
minikube config set memory 6144
minikube delete
minikube start
```

Also, if you typically need to access the Kafka broker from the outside of Kube, you'll need to enable the `SSL Passthrough` on Nginx ingress controller. Here below is the command that is used in above video:

```sh
$ kubectl patch -n kube-system deployment/ingress-nginx-controller --type='json' \
    -p '[{"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-","value":"--enable-ssl-passthrough"}]'
```
