The Microcks Backstage provider discovers APIs from one or more Microcks instances and syncs them into the Backstage Software Catalog as `API` entities. This page explains how to install, configure, and verify the provider in your Backstage app.

- **Plugin repository**: https://github.com/microcks/microcks-backstage-provider
- **Overview blog post**: https://microcks.io/blog/backstage-integration-launch/

## Prerequisites

- A running Backstage application (backend package available)
- A running Microcks instance and its base URL, for example: `https://microcks.acme.com`
- A Microcks Service Account in your Keycloak realm, with client id and secret
  - See: [/documentation/explanations/service-account](/documentation/explanations/service-account)

## 1. Install the provider

Add the provider to your Backstage backend:

```bash
yarn add --cwd packages/backend @microcks/microcks-backstage-provider@^0.0.2
```

## 2. Configure providers in `app-config.yaml`

Declare one or more Microcks named providers under the Backstage catalog section. Each provider points to a Microcks instance and defines sync options.

```yaml
catalog:
  providers:
    microcksApiEntity:
      dev:
        baseUrl: https://microcks.acme.com
        serviceAccount: microcks-serviceaccount
        serviceAccountCredentials: ab54d329-e435-41ae-a900-ec6b3fe15c54
        systemLabel: domain
        ownerLabel: team
        schedule: # optional; same options as in TaskScheduleDefinition
          frequency: { minutes: 2 }
          timeout: { minutes: 1 }
      prod:
        baseUrl: https://microcks.example.com
        serviceAccount: backstage-sync
        serviceAccountCredentials: ${MICROCKS_BACKSTAGE_SYNC_SECRET}
        systemLabel: system
        ownerLabel: owner
```

- **baseUrl**: Public base URL of your Microcks instance (no trailing `/api/`).
- **serviceAccount / serviceAccountCredentials**: Credentials of a Service Account in the Microcks Keycloak realm used to query Microcks. Prefer storing secrets in environment variables.
- **systemLabel / ownerLabel**: Microcks labels to map onto Backstage `system` and `owner` fields of the `API` entity. Choose labels that exist on your APIs in Microcks.
- **schedule**: Optional sync cadence. If omitted, the default provider schedule applies.

For guidance on creating and managing Service Accounts and understanding default roles, see [/documentation/explanations/service-account](/documentation/explanations/service-account). For Keycloak-related configuration in Microcks, see [/documentation/references/configuration/security-config](/documentation/references/configuration/security-config).

## 3. Register the provider in your backend

Add the provider to the catalog plugin initialization in your Backstage backend (for example in `packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts`). The exact file may vary depending on your app-template version.

```ts
import { MicrocksApiEntityProvider } from '@microcks/microcks-backstage-provider';

// within your builder/initializer
builder.addEntityProvider(
  MicrocksApiEntityProvider.fromConfig(env.config, {
    logger: env.logger,
    scheduler: env.scheduler,
  }),
);
```

Ensure your backend loads configuration from `app-config.yaml` and that the provider key path (`catalog.providers.microcksApiEntity`) matches your YAML.

## 4. Authentication and permissions

The provider authenticates to Microcks using a Keycloak client (Service Account). At minimum, it needs read access to list APIs and artifacts in Microcks. If you use the default realm import, the `microcks-serviceaccount` exists by default. For production, create a dedicated client for Backstage and scope it to read-only permissions.

- How to inspect or create accounts: [/documentation/explanations/service-account](/documentation/explanations/service-account)
- How Microcks references Service Accounts in its own configs: [/documentation/references/configuration/security-config](/documentation/references/configuration/security-config)

## 5. Verify the synchronization

1. Start your Backstage backend so the provider can run on schedule.
2. In Microcks, pick an API that has a name, version, and at least one artifact (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/gRPC).
3. Wait for the next scheduled run (or restart the backend to trigger immediately).
4. In Backstage, open Catalog â†’ APIs and search for the synchronized APIs.
5. Inspect an API entity details page; you should see links to the API contract, mock sandbox, and test results.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **No APIs appear in Backstage**
  - Verify `baseUrl` points to the public Microcks URL and is reachable from the Backstage backend.
  - Check that the Service Account is valid and has permissions; try using its client id/secret to get a token against Keycloak.
  - Ensure your labels mapping (`systemLabel`, `ownerLabel`) corresponds to actual labels in Microcks (or omit them initially).
  - Increase backend log level and look for logs from `MicrocksApiEntityProvider`.

- **Auth or 401 errors**
  - Re-check the Service Account credentials and Keycloak realm. If using environment variables, confirm they are exported to the backend process.

- **Slow or infrequent updates**
  - Tune the `schedule.frequency` and `schedule.timeout` values. Avoid overly aggressive schedules in production.

- **Conflicting ownership or duplicates**
  - Confirm only one provider is responsible for a given set of APIs. If combining multiple Microcks instances, use consistent labeling to distinguish systems and owners.
