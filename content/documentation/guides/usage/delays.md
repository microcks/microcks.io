## Overview

When using mocks to simulate a backend dependency, it may be more realistic to have responses that do not come immediately but **reproduce the dependency response time and latency**. Microcks allows you to specify such delays in different ways.

This guide shows you how to use Microcks to configure and simulate delays - or response time - for your mocks. You'll learn through a simple example how to do so on a REST API, but the principles remain the same for the other protocols and API styles.

## 1. Concepts

In Microcks, response time can be defined at three different levels:

* A default delay can be set at the **API operation** level, this one applies to all incoming requests if no the delay overrides this value,
* A delay can be defined at the **API endpoint** level. This allows consumers to specify the delay they'd like to see applied depending on their usage of the mock. This value overrides the API operation default delay when specified,
* Delays can also be defined at the **API request** level, allowing consumers to dynamically change the mock response time for each and every request. This approach is particularly convenient if you are using a load injection tool and that your application is propagating headers to the mocks.

Let's dive in and use them in action! ü§ø üê†

## 2. Practice

To practice setting up delays, you can reuse the `API Pastry` sample described in our [Getting Started](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started) tutorial. Once the API is loaded in Microcks, access the `GET /pastry` operation **Edit Properties** page from the 3-dots menu.

<br></br>

The **Default delay** in the dispatching properties has not been set, so it should be `0 ms`. You can change this value to one of your choice, let's say `250 ms` for our experiment. Do not forget to **Save**!

Now let's do some tests to check Microcks' behavior regarding response time, chaining the `time` and `curl` commands to call the operation:

```sh
time curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8585/rest/API+Pastry+-+2.0/2.0.0/pastry' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
will produce the following output:
```sh
[...]
0,01s user 
0,01s system 
2% cpu 
0,284 total
```

So our `250 ms` delay has been applied correctly! The difference is just a matter of the network transmission and processing time on the client side.

Ok. We just saw the **API operation** level, what about the **API endpoint** level? Well, this one is easy: you just need to add a `delay` parameter to your endpoint URL. Let's try it without further ado:

```sh
time curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8585/rest/API+Pastry+-+2.0/2.0.0/pastry?delay=500' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
will produce the following output:
```sh
[...]
0,00s user 
0,01s system 
1% cpu 
0,524 total
```

The `500 ms` delay has overridden the default delay set at the operation level! üéâ

Now, finally, let's see how to override things at the request level. This is as simple as setting a `x-microcks-delay` HTTP header! To demonstrate that it supercedes all over delays definition, we will keep the previous one and issue the following command:

```sh
time curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8585/rest/API+Pastry+-+2.0/2.0.0/pastry?delay=500' -H 'x-microcks-delay: 800' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```
That will produce the following output:
```sh
[...]
0,00s user 
0,00s system 
0% cpu 
0,826 total
```

We have now waited `800 ms` before receiving the response as specified in the header.

So cool! üôå You have now defined a per-request delay that will change with the header value. And remember that these mechanisms are exactly the same for all the API kinds and protocols supported by Microcks!

## 3. Other ways of proceeding

Defining the **Default delay** view the Microcks UI can be cumbersome. You have plenty of other ways to do so:
* Using our [OpenAPI extensions](/documentation/references/artifacts/openapi-conventions/#openapi-extensions) if you're dealing with REST APIs,
* Using an additional [APIMetadata artifact](/documentation/references/metadada/#api-metadata-properties) if you don't want this information to be mixed with your API definition or if your dealing with GraphQL or gRPC services,
* Via the [Microcks API](/documentation/references/apis/open-api/) using the `PUT /services/{id}/operation` directly.

## Wrap-up

Response delays are an easy to use and powerful mechanism for even more realistics simulation of your dependencies. As a developer, you can now boostrap your project with these response time constraints directly simulated during your development iterations!
