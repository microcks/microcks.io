## Overview

This guide shows you how to integrate Microcks into your [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) Pipelines. Microcks provides 2 Tekton `Tasks` for interacting with a Microcks instance. They allow you to:

* Import [Artifacts](/documentation/references/artifacts/) in a Microcks instance. If import succeeds is pursuing, if not it fails,
* Launch a test on a deployed API endpoint. If test succeeds (ie. API endpoint is conformant with API contract in Microcks) the workflow is pursuing, if not it fails.

Those 2 tasks are basically a wrapper around the [Microcks CLI](/documentation/guides/automation/cli/) and are using [Service Account](/documentation/explanations/service-account/).

## 1. Import Tasks in your cluster

Microcks Tekton Tasks are located in the `/tekton` folder of [the Microcks CLI repository](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-cli/tree/master/tekton).

The [`microcks-import-task.yaml`](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-cli/blob/master/tekton/microcks-import-task.yaml) holds a Tekton Task definition for importing artifacts.

The [`microcks-test-task.yaml`](https://github.com/microcks/microcks-cli/blob/master/tekton/microcks-test-task.yaml) holds a Tekton Task definition for launching test.

Both tasks require that you first create a Kubernetes `Secret` named `microcks-keycloak-client-secret` to hold your **Service Account** information, here's below a sample of such a Secret using the default provided Service Account information:

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: microcks-keycloak-client-secret
stringData:
  clientId: microcks-serviceaccount
  clientSecret: ab54d329-e435-41ae-a900-ec6b3fe15c54
```

After having created the above secret, you can import both tasks in your cluster namespace:

```sh
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microcks/microcks-cli/master/tekton/microcks-import-task.yaml -n my-namespace
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microcks/microcks-cli/master/tekton/microcks-test-task.yaml -n my-namespace
```

## 2. Use Tasks in a Pipeline

Once the tasks are registrated within your cluster namespace, you can integrate them within your `Pipeline` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: user-registration-tekton-pipeline
spec:
  tasks:
    - name: deploy-app
      taskRef:
        [...]
    - name: test-openapi-v1
      taskRef:
        name: microcks-test
      runAfter: 
        - deploy-app
      params:
        - name: apiNameAndVersion
          value: "User registration API:1.0.0"
        - name: testEndpoint
          value: http://user-registration.apps.acme.com
        - name: runner
          value: OPEN_API_SCHEMA
        - name: microcksURL
          value: https://microcks.acme.com/api/
        - name: waitFor
          value: 8sec
```

Here above, your pipleine will first deploy your application and then ask Microcks to execute an `OPEN_API_SCHEMA` conformance test on the freshly deployed application (supposed to be on the `http://user-registration.apps.acme.com` endpoint here).

The parameters that can be set here are:

* The `apiNameAndVersion` to launch tests for: this is simply a `service_name:service_version` expression,
* The `testEndpoint` to test: this is a valid endpoint where your service or API implementation has been deployed,
* The `runner` to use: this is the test strategy you may want to have regarding endpoint,
* The `microcksURL` to access the  Microcks API endpoint,
* The `waitFor` that is the specification of a test timeout.

## 3. Run your Pipeline

`Pipeline` can be executed through a new `PipelineRun` resource creation or using the `tkn` CLI tool. This time we're using the CLI tool to start a new pipeline:

```sh
  tkn pipelinerun start user-registration-tekton-pipeline
```

```sh
PipelineRun started: user-registration-tekton-pipeline-run-64xf7
Showing logs...
[...]
```

`tkn` can also be used later to retrieve the logs for the pipeline execution:

```sh
  tkn pipeline logs user-registration-tekton-pipeline-run-64xf7 -f -n user-registration
```

```sh
[...]

[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] MicrocksClient got status for test "5f76e969dcba620f6d21008d" - success: false, inProgress: true 
[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] MicrocksTester waiting for 2 seconds before checking again or exiting.
[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] MicrocksClient got status for test "5f76e969dcba620f6d21008d" - success: false, inProgress: true 
[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] MicrocksTester waiting for 2 seconds before checking again or exiting.
[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] MicrocksClient got status for test "5f76e969dcba620f6d21008d" - success: true, inProgress: false 
[test-openapi-v1 : microcks-test] Full TestResult details are available here: https://microcks.acme.com/#/tests/5f76e969dcba620f6d21008d

[...]
```

Using the [OpenShift Pipelines](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/pipelines) implementation of Tekton, you may easily get all this information at hands within the Developer Console of your OpenShift cluster. Here's belo a capture of our pipeline execution:

## Wrap-up

You have learned how to get and use the Microcks Tekton Tasks for your pipeline running on Kubernetes! ðŸŽ‰
