This guide shows you how to install and run Microcks using Docker Compose.

[Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) is a tool for easily testing and running multi-container applications. [Microcks](https://microcks.io/) offers a simple way to set up the minimal required containers to have a functional environment on your local computer. This procedure has been successfully tested with Podman `2.1.1` onto [Fedora 33+](https://getfedora.org/) and should be OK on [CentOS Stream 8+](https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/) and [RHEL 8+](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) distributions too.

To get started, make sure you first have the [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) and the [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) packages installed on your system.

Then, in your terminal issue the following commands:

1. Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microcks/microcks.git --depth 10
```

2. Change to the install folder

```sh
cd microcks/install/podman-compose
```

3. Spin up the containers in [rootless mode](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md) using our utility script:

```sh
./run-microcks.sh
```
```sh

On macos, need to get the userid and groupid from postman machine.
Assuming this machine is named 'podman-machine-default'. Change name in script otherwise.

Starting Microcks using podman-compose ...
------------------------------------------

Stop it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' stop
Re-launch it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' start
Clean everything with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' down

------------------------------------------
Go to https://localhost:8080 - first login with admin/microcks123
Having issues? Check you have changed microcks.yml to your platform
```
```sh
podman-compose -f microcks.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' up -d
```

This will start the required containers and setup a simple environment for your usage.

Open a new browser tab and point to the `http://localhost:8080` endpoint. This will redirect you to the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Single Sign On page for login. Use the following default credentials to login into the application:

* **Username:** `admin`
* **Password:** `microcks123`

You will be redirected to the main dashboard page.

### Enabling Asynchronous API features

Support for Asynchronous API features of Microcks are not enabled by default. If you feel your local machine has enough resources to afford it, you can enable them using a slightly different command line.

In your terminal use the following command instead:

```sh
./run-microcks.sh async
```
```sh
On macos, need to get the userid and groupid from postman machine.
Assuming this machine is named 'podman-machine-default'. Change name in script otherwise.

Starting Microcks using podman-compose ...
------------------------------------------

Stop it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml -f microcks-template-async-addon.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' stop
Re-launch it with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml -f microcks-template-async-addon.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' start
Clean everything with: podman-compose -f microcks.yml -f microcks-template-async-addon.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' down

------------------------------------------
Go to https://localhost:8080 - first login with admin/microcks123
Having issues? Check you have changed microcks.yml to your platform
```
```sh
podman-compose -f microcks.yml -f microcks-template-async-addon.yml --podman-run-args='--userns=keep-id:uid=501,gid=1000' up -d
```

Podman compose is now launching additional containers, namely `zookeeper`, `kafka` and the `microcks-async-minion`.

You may want to check our [blog post](/blog/async-features-with-docker-compose) for a detailed walkthrough on starting Async features on docker-compose (Podman compose is very similar).

### Development mode

A development oriented mode, without the Keycloak service is also available thanks to:

```sh
./run-microcks.sh dev
```

This configuration enabled Asynchronous API features in a very lightweight mode using [Red Panda broker](https://redpanda.com/) instead of full-blown Apache Kafka distribution.

## Wrap-up

You just installed Microcks on your local machine using Podman Compose and terminal commands. Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

You have discover that Microcks provides a bunch of default profiles to use different capabilities of Microcks depending on your working situation. Advanced profiles are using local configuration files mounted from the `/config` directory. You can refer to the [Application Configuration Reference](/documentation/references/configuration/application-config) to get the full list of configuration options.
