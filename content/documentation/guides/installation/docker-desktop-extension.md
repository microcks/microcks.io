This guide shows you how to install Microcks as a Docker Desktop Extension on your local machine. This way of installing Microcks is very convenient for people wanted to start quickly with most common Microcks capabilities and without hitting the terminal ðŸ‘»

[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is a simple-to-install application for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/), [Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/) that allows you to create and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes the Docker Engine, the Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and the Credential Helper.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [Docker Desktop installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on your system. Then, once it is running

1. Select **Add Extensions** and type `microcks` in the search box,

2. Choose Microcks, install and launch it and you are ready to go ðŸ¤©

> The video just below illustrates the installation process as well as the creation of a first [Direct API](/documentation/guides/usage/direct-api/). It has never been simpler to set up and use Microcks on a laptop. ðŸ™Œ

## Settings

The settings panel allows you to configure some options like whether you'd like to enable the **Asynchronous APIs features** (default is disabled) and if you'd need to set an offset to ports that are used to access the services.

Pretty straight forward!
